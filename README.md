# RECS

An entity component system written in [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/), for use in [Roblox](https://create.roblox.com/).

## RobloxComponentSystem

RECS is largely a work-in-progress successor to [RobloxComponentSystem](https://github.com/tiffany352/RobloxComponentSystem).

Primary differences:
* Systems exist as a formalized concept
* Components have very little attached behavior
* Singleton components exist
